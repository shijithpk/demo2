This is the code and data for an interactive looking at how widespread health conditions like high blood pressure, high blood sugar and obesity are among adults in rural India.

The data was taken from [here](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/nfhs-data/).

You can see the interactive live [here].(https://shijithpk.github.io/demo2/)

Used a modified version of Adam Pearce's [Graph-Scroll.js library](1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/) to make this interactive. 

Apart from the Graph-Scroll.js library, I also used Gregor Aisch's [d3 jetpack](https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack), the [d3-geo microlibrary](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) and the tooltip library [d3-tip.js](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip).

You can see how the data was analysed in the [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shijithpk/demo2/blob/master/iPython_notebook.ipynb).

Based a lot of my code on examples from bl.ocks.org and stackoverflow.com, have mentioned their urls where possible in [index.html](index.html).
